# What is Blend and how it works?

Blend is the first NFT Passport Engine and protocol on Botanix for Web3.0-based digital identity creation, management, and utilization in the ecosystem. The difference from the legacy digital identity representation on Web 3.0 is that Blend directly creates a complete and ultra-realistic virtual version of the Botanix user (just like a digital copy) and embeds all the digital identity data into an NFT-based passport. This means that each of the users on Botanix now has a 3D digital representation of themselves fully on the Botanix blockchain, managed in a decentralized way with full ownership via NFT technology. The digital identity creation process is also designed to be user-friendly with a low entry barrier, which just requires the user to upload a simple selfie of themselves, and Blend’s advanced deep learning AI core will perform the digital identity reconstruction fully on the cloud. Users just have to finally mint their digital identity into an NFT passport using our protocol, and then they are ready to utilize it around different DApp projects in the ecosystem. Users just have to connect their wallet containing the NFT Passport to the DApp, grant access for the DApp to use the Passport, and the DApp will fetch any related digital identity info from the Passport’s metadata.

### Some Interesting Use Cases with Blend (not limited to):

1. Imagine a blockchain game in which you can turn yourself into the game character and interact inside the metaverse. With NFT Passport, which has your complete face data embedded, you can easily achieve this. A blockchain game application can simply fetch your digital identity via the NFT Passport metadata and do the rendering work.

2. Imagine a metaverse-concept social application. Users can mint an ERC-5773-based NFT passport as their digital identity. This is because ERC-5773 can be used to permanently attach different formats of assets to the NFT passport. Users can not only store their own 3D data of their digital identity, but they can also bind their social media posts (images, texts, videos, etc.) to their NFT passport and carry them around.
 
3. Imagine the user’s NFT Passport is a profile in Web 3.0. By utilizing dynamic NFT implementations such as composable, multi-assets, and emotable, users can have a profile that is compatible with different DApps projects, achieving the concept of DApp-Agnostic. With these characteristics, developers can introduce more creative applications with the NFT Passport.
 
4. ZK-based identity applications are very popular in the blockchain space, while using user face data as an identity proof is relatively new to these kinds of applications. NFT Passport can achieve it as all the identity data of one user is permanently embedded into the NFT Passport.

# Key Features:

### Blend's Advanced Deep Learning AI Core

Blend's digital identity creation ability is powered by our university research team own developed advanced AI core, utilising the latest deep learning 3D reconstruction technology. It able to take up only a single selfie from the user as the input and directly generate an ultra-realistic 3D digital copy of the user. The AI core is hosted and running on-cloud, being the heart of the whole NFT Passport Engine, and distributed as API together with Blend NFT Passport Engine for Botanix developers to easily integrate to any DApps project on Botanix.

### Dynamic NFT Passport Implementation with RMRK NFT 2.0 Standard

Blend is the first NFT Passport engine and digital identity protocol to implement RMRK NFT 2.0 standard, introducing dynamic features to the NFT Passport, extend more possibile use case on NFT Passport. NFT Passport now had achieved storing complete user digital identity, bind multi-format assets or arbitrary data permanently, attach inventory catalog for equippable and composability, as well as allow users on Botanix to react emoji to it.  

### Achieve Self-Sovereign State via Blockchain-Based Encryption Mechanism 

Digital identity data is considered sensitive data and should be stored in a confidential way when making it fully on chain on the public Botanix network. Blend solved this by leveraging blockchain-based encryption mechanism by encrypting the 3D data of user before minting it into an NFT, hence, even the NFT Passport is accessible on chain, but only the owner of the NFT Passport has the access control to decrypt the digital identity data, having the full ownership. User also able to grant access to Blend powered DApp so that the application able to utilise the digital identity data when user connected their wallet. 

### Multiplatform Integration Ability (for both Web and Mobile-based DApps)

We do not want to limit the NFT Passport engine to only Web-based DApps on Botanix, but also should open the sector of mobile-based DApps which can also now utilise NFT Passport and explore more digital identity applications. Hence, Blend is also specially designed and built to allow full mobile integration, on both Android and IOS. Everything done in web-based DApps on Botanix can be easily recreate for mobile user now. Building up the the foundation of future Botanix Mobile Stack (BMS).

# Why Blend?

### Blend is cheaper and faster

Blend able to achieve 10K times cheaper when creating a single digital identity and mint into an NFT Passport on Botanix with super low gas fee benefit. This is compared to expensive Web2.0 product which can achieve digital identity creation ability such as Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest Pro (future release). Plus, Blend only need 1 minute to create a single digital identity NFT Passport, which is super fast. The advantages of cost and speed of the engine allow Blend to scale and accessible for everyone in the Botanix ecosystem, making 3D digital identity possible in blockchain application.

### Blend is cross-platform

Interoperability is a main focus in Botanix ecosystem, to ensure that tokenized assets can be travel across different project and still being compatible for each other, achieveing the concept which our team is focusing on - DApp Agnostic. Blend's NFT Passport able to achieve cross-platform (or cross project) ability which the digital identity data can be carry across different DApps in Botanix and able to utilise the digital identity in the application. Compared to Web2.0 product, which the digital identity created on one platform is not compatible with another one, making Blend stands out in the blockchain sector, fully leveraging Botanix technology. 

### Blend is the first on Botanix

Our team deserve a pat on the back! We are the first to introduce advanced AI backed digital identity engine and protocol on Botanix, introducing the concept of NFT Passport on Botanix.

# Blend's Market Potential Impact

Blend is building up the early Botanix ecosystem as we know that our next generation digital identity NFT Passport have broad application on different sector (such as blockchain gamimg, social application, NFT-extend application, etc) in the Botanix blockchain. Our team is tackling a large market size in the space and speculate a bright future in powering different DApp projects in the Botanix ecosystem. The launch of Blend will redefine how Web3.0 DApps will be designed and developed on Botanix. We will continue making our business model simple, which we will provide dynamic API subscription for projects, starting from only as low as $0.05 per digital identity. What we consider Blend a success? Our team wanted to successfully launch Blend as a plug-and-play solution on Botanix and get ready for mass adoption. This is also a focus which we are focusing on right now!
